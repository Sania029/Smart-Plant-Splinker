**🌱 Smart Plant Sprinkler System using Arduino**

**🔍 Project Overview**

This Smart Sprinkler System is designed to automate irrigation by monitoring soil moisture levels. It uses a soil moisture sensor to detect the water content in the soil and controls a relay to turn a water pump on or off accordingly.

**🚀 Features**

Automatic Irrigation – Turns the water pump on/off based on soil moisture.

Energy Efficient – Activates only when required, reducing power consumption.

Simple & Cost-Effective – Uses basic electronic components for easy implementation.

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

Microcontroller: Arduino

Sensors: Soil Moisture Sensor

Actuator: 5V Relay Module & Water Pump

Programming Language: C++ (Arduino)

**📜 How It Works**

The soil moisture sensor detects moisture levels in the soil.

If the soil is dry, the Arduino activates the relay, turning on the water pump.

If the soil is sufficiently moist, the relay turns off the pump to save water.

**🏗️ Installation & Usage**

1.Clone this repository

2.Open the smartsprink.ino file in Arduino IDE.

3.Connect the Arduino to your PC and upload the code.

4.Connect the soil moisture sensor and relay module to the specified pins.

5.Power on the system and observe its automatic irrigation process.
